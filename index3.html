    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I’m an Economist that has gone Data Analyst and Web Developer. As a Data Analyst I feel an urge to understand and explain the world. I love exploring behaviors and trends, and creating consumer insights. As a Web Developer I love to create well designed, functional and accessible web pages. All togehter I bring a sense of creativity and curiosity, and I’m always eager to expand my skills.
        I'm a Data Analyst and an Economist that loves diving into numbers to find insight. Insights that help to understand the future as well as bringing value to the company and its costumers. I'm a team player that pulls my own weight. Uncovering things that lead to change and improvements drive me.
        I've worked with both internal and external data sources. In most cases, I've had the benefit of being the person who can analyze already gathered data. I've also experienced being responsible for the entire lifecycle of data, from acquisition to actionable insight.
